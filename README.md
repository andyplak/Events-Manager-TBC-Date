# Events Manager - Event Date To Be Confirmed

A small add on plugin for WordPress [Events Manager](http://wp-events-plugin.com/) that allows an event to be configured so that the date shows as _To Be Confirmed_.


### Installation

Clone or copy the files into your `wp-content/plugins` folder and activate the plugin as you would with any other.


### Usage

Once activated, when editing or adding a new Event Post, then a checkbox will appear in the When metabox. Check this if you wish the event to show up as To Be Confirmed on the front end of the website. Please note: __a date still needs to be set for the event to be published, it just won't be shown to front end users.
